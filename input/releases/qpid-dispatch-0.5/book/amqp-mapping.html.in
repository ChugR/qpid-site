<h1>3.3. AMQP Mapping<a class="headerlink" href="#amqp-mapping" title="Permalink to this headline">.</a></h1>
<p>Dispatch Router is an AMQP router and as such, it provides extensions,
code-points, and semantics for routing over AMQP. This page documents the
details of Dispatch Router&#8217;s use of AMQP.</p>

encountered by a transiting message. The router will,

is present, the address in this field shall be used for
routing in lieu of the <em>to</em> field in the message
properties. A router may append, remove, or modify this
annotation field depending on the policy in place for
routing the message.</td>

<h2>3.3.5. Implementation of the AMQP Management Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-of-the-amqp-management-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">.</a></h2>
<p>Qpid Dispatch is manageable remotely via AMQP. It is compliant with the
emerging AMQP Management specification (draft 9).</p>
<p>Differences from the specification:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <cite>name</cite> attribute is not required when an entity is created. If
not supplied it will be set to the same value as the system-generated
&#8220;identity&#8221; attribute. Otherwise it is treated as per the standard.</li>
<li>The <cite>REGISTER</cite> and <cite>DEREGISTER</cite> operations are not implemented. The router
automatically discovers peer routers via the router network and makes
their management addresses available via the standard GET-MGMT-NODES
operation.</li>
</ul>
